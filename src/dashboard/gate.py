"""Single human-in-the-loop hook, evaluated at the END of every round.

The manager calls one hook per round with the round's ``outcome`` and
``reached_max``. The hook classifies whether a human gate is needed and, if so,
raises a blocking approval dialog. Trigger conditions (see ``_TRIGGERS``):

1. ``completed`` / ``max_rounds``: the run finished or hit the round budget.
2. ``needs_human``: the round's output explicitly requires human intervention
   (manager reported blocked).
3. ``repeated_failure``, a special condition: too many failing rounds in a row.

Adding a new trigger = add one ``_Trigger`` to ``_TRIGGERS`` and one clause in
``_classify``; nothing else changes.
